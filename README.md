Welcome To Wizard Game!

This is a solo indie dev project, so any and all help is very very much appreciated.

The Goal: Create a simple 2d PvP game, played on one keyboard, where the players use spells and items to slay eachother.

This project uses a custom 2d Python graphics library, by the name of NebulaTK. To install it, all you have to do is type `pip install nebulatk`. Both this project and NebulaTK are very much in development, so feel free to report bugs that you may find (https://github.com/CTRL-ALT-OP/nebulatk).
