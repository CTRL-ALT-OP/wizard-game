Thanks for trying out this game! I appreciate any and all
feedback (yes, even negative feedback), as it helps
make the game better, for you :)

To start playing, all you have to do is go into the game folder, and
double-click the file named "wizard game.exe". That should launch
the game, and from there, all you have to do is grab a friend,
and have fun!

The controls are as follows:
W - Player 1 move up
S - Player 1 move down
A - Player 1 move left
D - Player 1 move right
C - Player 1 melee
E - Player 1 use item
1,2,3,4 - Player 1 select hotbar slot corresponding to the number

I - Player 2 move up
K - Player 2 move down
J - Player 2 move left
L - Player 2 move right
. - Player 2 melee
O - Player 2 use item
7,8,9,0 - Player 2 select hotbar slot corresponding to the number (7 -> 1, 8 -> 2, 9 -> 3, 0 -> 4)

T - reset the game
