1 roast - cheap cut of beef is fine - put into roasting pan
montreal steak spice - sprinkle all over roast
2 generous tablespoons onion soup powder (from bulk barn) - put into roasting pan next to roast
2 generous tablespoons brown gravy powder (from bulk barn) - put into roasting pan next to roast
add water to roasting pan - about 1 & 1/2 to 2 inches deep
OPTIONAL - cut up some onions, spread around the roast in the water
put lid on roasting pan
bake in oven at 325 degrees F until the beef pulls apart easily with a fork. This can take from 2 to 4 hours depending on the size of the roast. I usually check it around the 1 & 1/2 hour time mark. 
pull beef apart with forks, spread into the gravy mixture, eat and enjoy!
